### Python unit test basics:

- Fixture: are used to configure the initial state necessary for tests to be run and also to clean up resources after test execution, ensuring an isolated and predictable environment for each test.
    - See all the fixtures on the project: 
    - `pytest --fixtures`
- Conftest: shared functions for testing 

### How to setup project:
- Install pytest
- `pip install pytest` 
- Run the tests:
    - `pytest`
